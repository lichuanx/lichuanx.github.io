# Lichuan Xiang | ÂêëÂäõÂ∑ù

I am an Honorary Research Fellow at the University of Warwick and a Founding Research Scientist at Collov.ai. My research focuses on efficient Machine Learning systems, with expertise in neural architecture design, model compression, and automated ML systems that operate under resource constraints.

## Research Interests

My work falls into these main areas:

1. **Neural Architecture Search (NAS)**: I develop methods that can automatically discover optimal neural network architectures for specific tasks, with a focus on efficiency and performance.

2. **Model Compression and Pruning**: My research explores novel techniques to reduce the computational requirements of deep learning models while maintaining accuracy, particularly focusing on pruning at initialization.

3. **Efficient Deep Learning**: I work on creating algorithms that significantly reduce ML computation across the full lifecycle from architecture discovery to training and inference.

4. **Controllable Generation with Diffusion Models**: I develop methods for precise control of diffusion-based generative models, enabling spatially-aware object manipulation that follows photorealistic principles and physical constraints. My research focuses on computation-aware architectures for diffusion models that maintain quality while improving efficiency.

5. **Agentic Systems**: I research autonomous AI systems that can plan, reason, and execute complex tasks through dynamic tool use and environment interaction. This includes developing architectures that support self-directed learning and decision-making in multi-step reasoning tasks.

## Current Work

At Collov.ai, I lead several key projects:
- Indoor 3D space reconstruction from single images
- Diffusion model training for image editing tasks
- Performance optimization of diffusion models
- Development of virtual staging tools for interior design

At the University of Warwick, I continue my research in efficient ML systems and supervise doctoral students working on related topics.

## Recent Achievements

- üèÜ **Best Paper Award** at AutoML Conference 2023 for our work on "Exploiting network compressibility and topology in zero-cost NAS"
- Published papers in top-tier conferences including ICML, ICLR, AAAI, and NeurIPS
- Successfully completed my Ph.D. in Computer Science from the University of Warwick (2024)
