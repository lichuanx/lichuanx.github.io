### Research Focus

My research primarily focuses on building efficient Machine Learning systems. I specialize in developing innovative methods for neural architecture design, model compression, and automated ML systems that can operate effectively under resource constraints.

My work typically falls into these key areas:

1. **Neural Architecture Search (NAS)**: I develop methods that can automatically discover optimal neural network architectures for specific tasks, with a focus on efficiency and performance.

2. **Model Compression and Pruning**: My research explores novel techniques to reduce the computational requirements of deep learning models while maintaining accuracy, particularly focusing on pruning at initialization.

3. **Efficient Deep Learning**: I work on creating algorithms that significantly reduce ML computation across the full lifecycle from architecture discovery to training and inference.

The overarching goal of my research is to make ML systems more accessible, efficient, and deployable in real-world scenarios where computational resources are limited.

### Research Projects

#### Zero-Cost Neural Architecture Search
This project focuses on developing methods to evaluate the quality of neural architectures without expensive training. Our approach leverages network characteristics and topology to predict performance, making NAS more accessible and efficient.

#### Differentiable Pruning at Initialization
We explore novel techniques for pruning neural networks at initialization, allowing for significant model compression before training. Our DPaI method introduces a Node-Path Balance Principle that guides pruning decisions.

#### Generative Modeling for Neural Architecture Design
This work uses hierarchical generative models to create neural architectures, allowing for more flexible and controlled design of neural networks.

### Collaborations

I actively collaborate with several research teams:

* **Samsung AI Centre Cambridge**: Working on model compression and neural architecture search for efficient mobile AI.
* **University of Warwick**: Collaborating on various ML research projects and supervising doctoral students.
* **Collov.ai**: Leading research on 3D space reconstruction and diffusion models for interior design applications.
